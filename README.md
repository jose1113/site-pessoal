# Site Pessoal

A simple personal website, about my skills, learning, and projects done and to be done.
In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS, [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and the [VLibras plugin](https://www.gov.br/governodigital/pt-br/vlibras).
